![](https://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/e/ec/Fo4_Hacker.png/revision/latest?cb=20170320162306)
Program that helps you through the unsolvable riddles from the text.

# Inspiration
What inspires me is that when I played Fallout 4 game, the riddles is long and hard to hack by yourself <br>
So, I create python program to find the answer to the riddles

# How to use
1. Start typing up all the possible answers (all the possible answer)
2. Press enter continue
3. Program will start finding relationships to the wording, and showing you the most possible answers
4. Choose one, and tell the program that you chose what word, and ends up with how much likeness
5. Repeat until you can find the answer

During test run of the program, sample size of the word is 6 characters long (Advanced level Terminal) and they can hack it within 4 attempts

I hoped you like the project!
